## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
#### Artifact One Narrative
The artifact is the first part of a three-part project. The main project is a hotel booking application that was first developed in the Software Development Lifecycle course. Through the application, the user can pick a hotel and book a room. This artifact will focus on the UI elements of the project. I selected this artifact since it will showcase my skills in creating an application that can be user-friendly and accessible. If an application is not accessible to everyone, from the tech-savvies to the social media only user, then it’s not well thought out. The first idea for this artifact was to list all the hotels on the same page. However, this would clog the main page since each hotel will display a list of the rooms and a short description. To improve, panels were developed and assigned to each hotel that the user can see by going back or forward through them.

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
#### Artifact Two Narrative
The artifact is the second part of a three-part project. It will focus on the connection between the application and the SQL Server Database. I selected this artifact since it will showcase my skills in working within different programming environments. The hotel’s information could’ve been stored in the main code. However, this would mean that this could is locked to this dataset. By creating a connection between the code and an exterior database, the code can be reused in other situations. Additionally, the code and the dataset can be maintained separately, meaning that separate teams can work on it simultaneously.
